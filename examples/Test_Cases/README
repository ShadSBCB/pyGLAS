These steps were followed for preparing the receptor for pyGLAS_v1:

Receptor file was downloaded from the PDB (Code.pdb)
All non-receptor atoms were removed from the PDB file (Code_Only_Protein.pdb)
Receptor was sent to the GPCRDb for residue numbering (Code_Only_Receptor_GPCRDB.pdb)
Protein is ready for pyGLAS!

There are likely to be problems when assigning residue numbering from the GPCRDb. In that case, one needs to assign the residue indeces manually.
Instructions on how to do this can be found in Documentation/Manual_CHICOs.txt
